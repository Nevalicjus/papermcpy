Introduction
============

Installation
------------

Run this in your terminal to install the library

.. code-block:: bash

	python3 -m pip install papermcpy

Usage
-----

Papermcpy can run synchronously (*sync*) or asynchronously (*async*), and by default runs synchronously.

To import papermcpy use:
```py
import papermcpy
```

And to import async papermcpy use:
```py
import papermcpy.a as papermcpy
```

Besides synchronicity, there is no difference between them.
